# git-merge-waterfall
A highly convenient way to keep all of your branches in sync. Starting at the first branch in the list, it will merge that into the second branch. At each point you are given the option to stop or continue. Place MergeWaterfall.sh in the root of your project and rename the branches in the project to fit your needs.
